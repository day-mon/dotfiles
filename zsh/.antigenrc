# Format follows [antigen bundle remote-repo/url]
# For example, zsh-users/zsh-completions, zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions actually point to github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions and github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions. Github is inferred automatically, if the repositories are hosted under a different domain, just specify the domain.
